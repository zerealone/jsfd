# JSFD
An npm package to help people with discord.js functions (The functions are similar to BDFD functions, that's why the package called JSFD).

## How to use
```js
const { Client, GatewayIntentBits } = require('discord.js'); //the discord.js library. you must add this in order to use also JSFD and to connect to your bot.
const client = new Client({ intents: [GatewayIntentBits.Guilds] }); //the bot intenets. you can change this to whatever you want.
const JSFD = require('jsfd'); //adds the package

client.on('ready', () => {
  console.log(`Logged in as ${client.user.tag}!`); //once the client ready, this message will be sent to the console
});

client.on('interactionCreate', async cmd => { //when an interaction creates. If you use other variable (that is not 'cmd' like here in the example) please change where there is 'cmd' also in the next lines to that var
  if (!cmd.isChatInputCommand()) return;
  if(cmd.commandName === 'ping'){ //you need to register your slash commands before use this.
      let message = JSFD.message(cmd)
      await cmd.reply(message.code(`<@$authorID> Pong! üèì`)); //reply to the interaction with '<@{the interaction author id}> Pong! üèì'
    }
});
```
The code used in the `message.code` function is just an example. A full list of the available functions are below, at the end of this README file. 

### `message.code()`
`message.code` is a function that convert the string that is in the `('')` to a discord.js function.

### `JSFD.message()`
This function **must** to be before the `message.code` function, to make this work. If there is no valid `JSFD.message()` function, there will be many errors.
